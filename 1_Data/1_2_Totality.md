# Totality

## Total function
A function is **total** if it is defined for all inputs of its corresponding type, or in other words, if a function returns the output on any possible values of the input.

## Partial function
A function is **partial** if it is non-total. Don't confuse this with **partial application** of functions!

GHC gives tools to check if a function is partial due to *non-exhaustive* patterns.
